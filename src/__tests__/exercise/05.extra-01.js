// ## Extra Credit

// ### 1. ðŸ’¯ reuse server request handlers

// In my applications, I love having a mock server to use during development. It's
// often more reliable, works offline, doesn't require a lot of environment setup,
// and allows me to start writing UI for APIs that aren't finished yet.

// MSW was actually originally built for this use case and we've already
// implemented this server handler for our app in `test/server-handlers.js`, so for
// this extra credit, import that array of server handlers and send it along into
// the `setupServer` call.

const buildLoginForm = build({
  fields: {
    username: fake(f => f.internet.userName()),
    password: fake(f => f.internet.password()),
  },
})

const server = setupServer(...handlers)

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterAll(() => server.close())

test(`logging in displays the user's username`, async () => {
  render(<Login />)
  const {username, password} = buildLoginForm()

  userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/username/i), username)
  userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), password)
  userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i}))

  const spinner = screen.getByLabelText(/loading/i)
  await waitForElementToBeRemoved(spinner)

  expect(screen.getByText(username)).toBeInTheDocument()
})
