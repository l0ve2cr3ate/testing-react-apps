// ## Extra Credit

// ### 1. ðŸ’¯ use userEvent

// As it turns out, clicking these buttons is also a bit of an implementation
// detail. We're firing a single event, when we actually should be firing several
// other events like the user does. When a user clicks a button, they first have to
// move their mouse over the button which will fire some mouse events. They'll also
// mouse down and mouse up on the input and focus it! Lots of events!

// If we want to be truly implementation detail free, then we should probably fire
// all those same events too. Luckily for us, Testing Library has us covered with
// `@testing-library/user-event`. This may one-day be baked directly into
// `@testing-library/dom`, but for now it's in a separate package.

// For this extra credit, swap out `fireEvent` for `userEvent` which you can get
// like so:

// ```javascript
// import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
// ```

// Once you're done, look around in the code of `@testing-library/user-event`'s
// [`click` method](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event/blob/1af67066f57377c5ab758a1215711dddabad2d83/src/index.js#L109-L131).
// It's pretty interesting!
