# 8. Testing Custom Hooks Notes

Your custom hooks is used in a component, so that is how it should be tested. The easiest and most straightforward way to test a custom hook is to create a component that uses it and test that component instead.

For more complex hooks that are difficult to test this way, you can you `@testing-library/react-hooks` which contains a `renderHook` function.
