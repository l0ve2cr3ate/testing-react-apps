# 2. Simple Test With React Testing Library Notes

`React Testing Library` provides abstractions so you don't have to create DOM nodes and append them to the DOM, etc.

```javascript
const {container} = render(<Example />)
```

`container` is the div your component has been mounted onto.

`React Testing Library` has `auto-cleanup` feature:
`test.afterEach(cleanup)`

Another automatic feature of `React Testing Library` is its handling of React's `act` function.
