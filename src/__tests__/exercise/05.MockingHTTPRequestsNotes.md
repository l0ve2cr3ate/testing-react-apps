# 5. Mocking HTTP Requests Notes

Testing that frontend interacts with backend is important. You can test that with E2E tests. For integration and unit tests you can start a mock server to handle all of `window.fetch` requests made during the tests.
`whatwg-fetch` is a polyfill for testing environment, which will allow MSW (Mock Service Worker) to handle those requests for you.
