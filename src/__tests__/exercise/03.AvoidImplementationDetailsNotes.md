# 3. Avoid Implementation Details

The implementation of your abstractions does not matter to the user of your abstraction, and if you have confidence that it continous to work through refactor then **neithter should your tests**.

Instead of selecting your button with: 

`container.firstChild`, select it with `screen.getByRole('button', {name: '0})`
First would break when you would wrap your button in an extra `<span>`, but the second would still work.
