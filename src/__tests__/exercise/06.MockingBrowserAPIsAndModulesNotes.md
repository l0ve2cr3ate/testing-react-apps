# 6. Mocking Browser APIs and modules Notes

## Mocking Browser APIs
Your tests run in a *simulated* browser environment in node. `jsdom` module makes this possible. `jsdom` can't simulate all browser behavior, like `window resize` or `media-queries`. So if you want/need to use these, you will have to mock/polyfill them: 

```javascript
import matchMediaPolyfill from 'mq-polyfill'

beforeAll(() => {
  matchMediaPolyfill(window)
  window.resizeTo = function resizeTo(width, height) {
    Object.assign(this, {
      innerWidth: width,
      innerHeight: height,
      outerWidth: width,
      outerHeight: height,
    }).dispatchEvent(new this.Event('resize'))
  }
})
```

Tools for testing are way faster and more capable when run in node.
Most of the time you can mock browser APIs for tests without losing to much confidence. However, if you are testing something that really relies on browser APIs or layout, like drag-and-drop, it may be better to write those tests in a real browser, for example using Cypress.

## Mocking Modules
`jest.mock('../math')`

Now all function exports from math.js module are jest mock function, so you can call `.mockImplementation()` on them and make assertions. It is also possible to mock only *parts* of a module:

```javascript
jest.mock('../math', () => {
    const actualMath = jest.requireActual('../math'),
    return {
        ...actualMath,
        subtract: jest.fn()
    }
})
```
